# g710-audio-visualizer
A music visualizer for the Logitech G710 and G710+. Will also work for other LogiLED-supported devices.

## Note:
A 64-bit PC and the 64-bit version of Java is required. I'd love to support 32-bit versions, but apparently Logitech's Java API does not support 32-bit machines right now. Sorry.

# g710-audio-visualizer
A music visualizer for the Logitech G710 and G710+. Will also work for other LogiLED-supported devices.

## Note:
If you are on a 64-bit machine, you must use the 64-bit version of Java.
If you are on a 32-bit machine, I am currently unsure whether or not the program will work. Please let me know if you've had any success in the "Issues" tab.
